# Dice

## My First Bootcamp App

This is the first app I developed during my iOS Development bootcamp. Although simple, this dice app played a crucial role in building my foundation in Swift and UIKit, teaching me both technical skills and important programming concepts.

## What the App Does

Inspired by the excitement of Las Vegas, this app simulates rolling dice. When the user taps the “ROLAR” button, two dice are rolled simultaneously, each displaying a random face between 1 and 6. It’s a fun and practical tool for games or making quick decisions on the go!


## What I Learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* * Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
